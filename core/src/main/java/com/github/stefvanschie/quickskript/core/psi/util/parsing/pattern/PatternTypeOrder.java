    /**
     * The order in which the types should be entered as parameters when invoking the referencing method. The index of
     * the number specifies the index of the type in the pattern, while the number itself specifies the position of the
     * method parameter. By default this will act as if the order is set to 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 2, n - 1, n, where n is
     * the amount of types in the pattern, which is represented by an empty array.
     *
     * To, for example, reverse the order in which the types are passed to the method's parameter, you'd specify n,
     * n - 1, n - 2, ..., 2, 1, 0. The amount of numbers specified here must be the same as the amount of types in the
     * representing pattern and a number may not be referenced twice in this order. In case you have multiple patterns
     * with different custom orders, multiple {@link PatternTypeOrder} annotations should be specified in the
     * {@link Pattern} annotation, since the order specified here will be applied to all patterns as referenced in
     * {@link #patterns}.
     *
     * Index 0 is specified as the first parameter which gets replaced by the type. This may not actually be the first
     * parameter of the method, however. For example, if the parameters start with a parameter indicative of the
     * {@link SkriptMatchResult}, this parameter is not counted towards this order: index 0 will be the first
     * {@link PsiElement} which indicates a type in the pattern. It is not possible to reference index -1 or lower to
     * override earlier parameters from before this array of type parameters. Additional parameters at the end of the
     * parameters, such as a line number, also do not count towards this count. It is also not possible to reference
     * these later parameters by setting an index higher than the type parameter array's size - 1. For example, if a
     * pattern with two types is referenced by the {@link Pattern}, specifying index 2 or higher is not possible.
